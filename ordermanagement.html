    <h1>What is order management?</h1>
    <p>Order management refers to the process of receiving, tracking, and fulfilling customer orders. It involves all the steps from the initial order placement to the final delivery of the product or service. Order management includes order processing, inventory management, shipment tracking, and customer support.</p>
    <p>The goal of effective order management is to ensure that orders are processed accurately and efficiently, reducing errors and delays. It is crucial for businesses to have a well-organized and streamlined order management system in place to meet customer expectations and maintain customer satisfaction.</p>
    <h1>How does order management work?</h1>
    <p>Order management is the process of overseeing all activities related to fulfilling customer orders. It involves receiving, processing, and delivering orders to customers in a timely and efficient manner. The process typically starts when a customer places an order, either online, over the phone, or in person. Once an order is received, it is usually entered into a system or software that tracks and manages the order throughout its lifecycle. A software helps manage inventory levels, tracks order status, and ensures timely delivery. The order management process involves various steps such as verifying the order details, checking inventory availability, processing payment, packaging the order, and arranging for shipping or delivery. This process may differ depending on the type of business and industry. Order management systems also handle customer service aspects, such as handling inquiries, providing order updates, and managing returns or exchanges. They help ensure a smooth and streamlined ordering experience for customers.</p>
